# Taskmanager website

Designed by Kyle Peeler

## Overview

 My third coding project: A task management website designed using React that
 allows users to create tasks and display them on a tasks page.

 Used to learn and display knowledge of React, React-Router, and Object-oriented programming.

## Details

- Contains a navbar using React-Router to allow quickly switching between pages.
- A home page using dropdown menus to display informational text.
- A Tasks page to allow creation and displaying of tasks and task related info.
- A completion system to mark tasks as complete when finished.
- A filter system to only display completed content, only display not completed content, or display all content.
- A contact form that handles data recieved from the form and displays it in the console log in the absense of a back-end server.
- Modular system using reusable components following the react fundamentals and principles of development.

## Usage

Source code hosted at <https://github.com/Kpeeler51/Task-Manager-Website>

Github Pages website hosted at <https://kpeeler51.github.io/Task-Manager-Website/>

- Enter the tasks page and enter a task name and description.
- Hit the "add task" button and it will be displayed in the list.
- Click on the task and its description will be displayed in the window to the right.
- Click on the checkbox to the left and the task title will be crossed out and marked as complete.
- Click the red trash can icon and a task will be removed from the list.
- Click on one of the three "active" "complete" or "all" buttons to filter content.

## Technologies Used

HTML5, CSS3, React, React-Router, Vite, Typescript.

## Future Improvements

- A system to allow saving of list content so it is not cleared on refresh.

- A better system for the contact page than console-logging the info.

- A system to edit already added tasks.
